### Summary Overview

Hi, I’m Darin Williams—an entrepreneur at heart, AI/ML engineer, and software developer proudly based in the great state of Texas. I’m passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and I love exploring how new technologies can positively impact people’s lives. I’m also a lifelong learner who’s always curious about what’s next on the horizon.
Among family and close friends, I go by my middle name, Jessie, in honor of my grandfather from North Carolina. I’m an outgoing person who genuinely enjoys helping others, and one of my greatest passions is mentoring—and being mentored. I believe mentorship is one of the best ways to grow, share knowledge, and connect with people… especially over a good cup of coffee. For me, that usually means a bold espresso—sometimes straight, sometimes with a little cream and shaved chocolate on top.

### Entrepreneur Spirit at Heart

I’ve always had an entrepreneurial spirit, and one of my long-time dreams is to open a cozy little coffee shop. For now, though, I’m pouring my energy into projects that are especially close to my heart—work centered around Artificial Intelligence. There’s more to come on that soon, and I’m excited to share the journey as it unfolds.
I’m also a big believer in lifelong learning and the power of educating yourself to keep growing. Before stepping into the tech world, I proudly served eight years in the U.S. Army, which gave me the chance to travel the globe, experience diverse cultures, and learn from people all around the world.

### Excitement

I’m genuinely excited about the future of Artificial Intelligence—and I hope you are too! When I’m not behind a computer, you’ll usually find me in the kitchen experimenting with new flavors and recipes that wake up the taste buds. Staying active is also a big part of my routine—I make it a point to stretch for at least 30 minutes every morning to stay fit and energized.
And then there’s my passion for motorcycles. I ride a Yamaha Vstar 1300, and there’s nothing quite like hitting the open road, feeling the wind rush past, and soaking in that sense of freedom. It’s the closest thing to flying without leaving the ground.
